Overview
This project simulates phone functionalities, providing a framework for understanding and interacting with telecommunication processes in a controlled environment. It is designed as a practical tool for learning about the inner workings of phone systems, including making and receiving calls, managing contacts, and other core features.

Contents
mini5main (1).c: The main C source file that initiates the simulation and ties together different components of the phone system.
mini5phone.c: Implements the simulated phone's functionalities, such as dialing, messaging, and contact management.
mini5phone (2).h: The header file for mini5phone.c, declaring necessary structures, functions, and variables.
logfile.txt: Contains logs of the system's execution, useful for debugging and tracking the simulation's behavior.
makefile (1): Automates the compilation process, simplifying the build procedure for the project.

Features
Simulated Phone Calls: Experience the process of making and receiving calls in a simulated environment.
Contact Management: Add, delete, and manage contacts within the simulation.
Messaging System: Simulate sending and receiving messages.
Log Tracking: Monitor actions and events within the system through a detailed log file.
